## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

Overview
---
In this project,  I created a deep model in Tensorflow using Convolutional Neural Networks to classify traffic signs. The model was  trained and validated using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). After the model was trained, it was tried out on images of German traffic signs found on the web. 

### Dependencies
This lab requires:

* [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit)

The lab enviroment can be created with CarND Term1 Starter Kit. Click [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/README.md) for the details.

### Dataset

The [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset) used in this project is automatically downloaded in the Juputer Notebook. 

### Run 

Open the Jupyter notebook Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb and run. This notebook is self-contained. Please note that the training time might be a lot if run on a CPU.
